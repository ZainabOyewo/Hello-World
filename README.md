# Hello-World
My first repository creation

I am zainab, 24yrs of age and I am passionte about design and building useful and sustainable things (tech-wise). I aspire to be an Andela fellow. Not just because it is "Andela" but because I want to grow passed where I am (Skill-wise), I am in pursuit of personal development to find my talent and I believe I am capable if I put my mind to it. I just need that push and Andela is the right place to start.
